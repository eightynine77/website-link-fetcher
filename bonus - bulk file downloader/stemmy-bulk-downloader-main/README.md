# stemmy
stemmy is a python script that allows you to download multiple files in bulk

## how to use
add your links you want to download to the "links.txt" file. 

you add your links into the file like this:

example.com/picture.png

example.com/archive_file.zip

example.com/video.mp4

## PLEASE READ
windows cmd by default **_do not support ANSII codes_**. meaning that if you run the [stemmy.py](https://github.com/eightynine77/stemmy-bulk-downloader/blob/main/stemmy.py) script on windows cmd, strange characters will appear. this script uses ANSII codes for displaying multiple text colors. this, however, does not mean it will make the script dysfunctional. it will just make it harder for you to read the output.

run [stemmy.py](https://github.com/eightynine77/stemmy-bulk-downloader/blob/main/stemmy.py) with powershell version 5.1 or newer or use windows terminal if you're running this script on windows. mac os and linux users will have no problem running this script on their respective terminals (zsh, bash, etc).

or alternatively, you can just run [stemmy-for-windows.py](https://github.com/eightynine77/stemmy-bulk-downloader/blob/main/stemmy-for-windows.py) on windows cmd
